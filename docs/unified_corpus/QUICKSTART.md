# Quickstart

## 1) Install (no deps required)
This is a pure‑Python package; place the folder anywhere and run the demo.

## 2) Run demo
```bash
python run_demo.py
```

You’ll see:
- 2 Seed papers/one digest/one LLM profile saved to SNAP
- Two personas created and composed into a hybrid
- Two code SNAPBITs saved; 1 stitched into a combined unit
- One error + playbook auto‑applied
- An MoE route choosing top‑K personas

## 3) Explore the store
Artifacts are saved to `snap_store/*.json`. Open any to inspect the schema and metadata.
