# Operational Tips for SNAP Sessions

- Use ArXiv + key AI research as first-tier SNAPTYPE sources
- Create digest SNAPTYPEs to condense large inputs
- Keep SNAP store organized by kind/prefix
- Use `query(kind=...)` to quickly list relevant artifacts
- Snapshot error traces immediately; link to playbook
- Build SNAPBIT library incrementally; every function counts
- Stitch from SNAPBITs before writing new code
- Test often; add passing code to SNAP store
- Maintain high-value personas; retire stale ones
