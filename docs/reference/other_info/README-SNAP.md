# SNAP System (Isolated)

A compact system for persistent, composable knowledge and operational state:

- **SNAP core** for saving/loading/querying typed states
- **Types** for ArXiv papers, digests, LLM profiles, algorithms, code units (SNAPBITs), errors, playbooks
- **SNAPDNA** personas + hybrid personas
- **SNAPBIT** stitcher (v0) for assembling code units into complete blocks
- **Playbook** executor (v0) to apply operational fixes
- **ThinkTank MoE (v0)** for routing tasks to top‑K personas

> Designed to maximize *teaching efficiency*: more durable capability per state saved.
